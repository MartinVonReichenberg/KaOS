**Web browser that blocks ads and trackers by default.**

Brave is available as a fast, free, secure web browser for your PC and mobile devices. Complete with a built-in ad blocker that prevents tracking, and optimized for mobile data and battery life savings. The new Brave browser blocks ads and trackers that slow you down and invade your privacy. Discover a new way of thinking about how the web can work.

*Brave is a free and open-source web browser developed by Brave Software, Inc. based on the Chromium web browser. Brave is a privacy-focused browser, which automatically blocks most advertisements and website trackers in its default settings. Users can turn on optional ads that reward them for their attention in the form of Basic Attention Tokens (BAT), which can be used as a cryptocurrency or to make payments to registered websites and content creators.*

*Brave Software's headquarters are in San Francisco, California.*

*As of December 2023, Brave reported more than 65.17 million monthly active users, 24.57 million daily active users and a network of more than 1.6 million content creators.*


*What is Brave Ad Replacement?*

*Braveâ€™s goal is to speed up the web, stop bad ads and pay publishers. One of the ways we plan to accomplish this is with ad replacements. We will also invite users to fund their wallets and to use those funds to pay the publishers of their favorite websites.*
