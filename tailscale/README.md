Tailscale is a VPN service that makes the devices and applications you own accessible anywhere in the world, securely and effortlessly. It enables encrypted point-to-point connections using the open source WireGuard protocol, which means only devices on your private network can communicate with each other.

#### The Benefits:

Building on top of a secure network fabric, Tailscale offers speed, stability, and simplicity over traditional VPNs.

Tailscale is fast and reliable. Unlike traditional VPNs, which tunnel all network traffic through a central gateway server, Tailscale creates a peer-to-peer mesh network (called a tailnet in addition with Magic DNS).
