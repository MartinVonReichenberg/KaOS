BalenaEtcher is an open-source utility that allows users to create bootable USB drives or SD cards by flashing disk images.
It provides a streamlined and user-friendly interface for the process, making it accessible to both beginners and experienced users alike.
BalenaEtcher supports a wide range of disk image formats, including ISO, IMG, and ZIP, allowing you to create bootable media for various operating systems, such as Linux distributions, Raspberry Pi, and other embedded devices.

_Here at balena we have thousands of users working through our getting started process, we found there was no easy way for our users to flash an SD card that we could recommend to everyone._

_So we built Etcher, an SD card flasher app that is simple for end users, extensible for developers, and works on any platform._

#### Features:

* Create USB installation media from bootable ISOs
* Install almost any OS to almost any flash drive
* Offer an easy way for your users to flash your OS using our ‘Flash with Etcher’ feature
