# KaOS

Backup - Repository/Depository of custom packages from KaOS out of KCP due to KCP and their maintainers not being there for the actual users' feedback and co-operation; without direct communication . . .

*This repository, in response, is SET to CHANGE that.*

_**And NO, you do not have to {must not} use that.**_
